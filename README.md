# CMOR438-Python-Package

# My Machine Learning Algorithms Package (e.g., ml_algorithms)

This Python package implements various machine learning algorithms, organized into supervised and unsupervised learning categories.

## Package Structure

The package is divided into 2 subfolders: ```supervised``` and ```unsupervised```. 

The ```supervised``` folder has 8 machine learning algorithms:
1. Perceptron
2. Neural Networks
3. Linear Regression
4. Logistic Regression
5. K-Nearest Neighbors
6. Decision Trees
7. Random Forests
8. Boosting

The ```unsupervised``` folder has 4 machine learning algorithms:
1. k-means Clustering
2. DBSCAN (Density Based Clustering)
3. Principal Components Analysis
4. Label Propagation for Graphs


## Installation


Within a Jupyter Notebook, import in the specific Machine Learning Model. For example, if you wanted to import Decision Trees, which is in the ```supervised``` folder, you could use:

```from my_ml_package.supervised.decision_trees import DecisionTreeRegressor```
